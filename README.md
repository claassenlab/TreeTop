# TreeTop

TreeTop is an algorithm for single-cell data analysis to identify and assess statistical significance of branch points in biological processes with possibly multi-level branching hierarchies. We demonstrate branch point identification for processes with varying topologies, including T cell maturation, B cell differentiation and hematopoiesis. Our analyses are consistent with recent experimental studies suggesting a shallow hierarchy of differentiation events in hematopoiesis, rather than the classical multi-level hierarchy.

TreeTop is described in the paper "Tree-ensemble analysis tests for presence of multifurcations in single cell data" (Will Macnair, Laura De Vargas Roditi, Stefan Ganscha, Manfred Claassen).

TreeTop is implemented in MATLAB.
