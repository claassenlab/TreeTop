# UNDER TESTING

The code in this repository is completely functional, but setting it up can involve a bit of tweaking of files (e.g. to make sure some necessary things have compiled). This should be fine for Windows users, but the tweaking may be necessary for Mac and Linux users.

If you're comfortable sorting out compilation etc on your own, please do download and try out TreeTop. If not, please come back in a couple of days once things are sorted! I am writing an install_TreeTop.m script which should make things straightforward.

Thanks
Will
